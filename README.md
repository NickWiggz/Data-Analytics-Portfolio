# Nicholas Wiggins - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About
Hello!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page. My name is **Nicholas Wiggins**, and I believe that data holds the key to unlocking insights and driving positive change. My journey into the world of data began over a decade ago, leading me through roles in acquisition and procurement, and ultimately culminating in a deep dive into data analytics. With a Master's in Data Analytics and Policy from Johns Hopkins University, I've developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with organizations like the Department of Defense and CISA, where I leveraged tools like R, Python, Tableau, Looker, and Mapbox to analyze complex datasets, build predictive models, and communicate findings effectively. I'm particularly proud of the projects featured in this portfolio, which demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world problems using data-driven approaches.

When I'm not immersed in data, I'm passionate about personal and professional growth. I love to travel, experience new cultures, and constantly seek out opportunities to learn and expand my horizons. Whether it's mastering a new programming language or exploring a new country, I'm always eager to challenge myself and embrace new experiences.
