# Nicholas Wiggins - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About
Hello!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my page. My name is **Nicholas Wiggins**, and I believe that data holds the key to unlocking insights and driving positive change. My journey into the world of data began over a decade ago, leading me through roles in acquisition and procurement, and ultimately culminating in a deep dive into data analytics. With a Master's in Data Analytics and Policy from Johns Hopkins University, I've developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with organizations like the Department of Defense and CISA, where I leveraged tools like R, Python, Tableau, Looker, and Mapbox to analyze complex datasets, build predictive models, and communicate findings effectively. I'm particularly proud of the projects featured in this portfolio, which demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world problems using data-driven approaches.

When I'm not immersed in data, I'm passionate about personal and professional growth. I love to travel, experience new cultures, and constantly seek out opportunities to learn and expand my horizons. Whether it's mastering a new programming language or exploring a new country, I'm always eager to challenge myself and embrace new experiences.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health in Teens
**Code:** [`The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health in Teens`](https://github.com/NickWiggz/Projects/blob/main/Social%20Media%20and%20Teens.Rmd)

**Document:** [`The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health in Teens`](https://rpubs.com/njwiggins/1266054)

**Goal:** To investigate the correlation between social media usage and mental health indicators among teenagers.

**Description:** This project analyzed survey data from a diverse group of high school students regarding social media and mental health. Data cleaning and analysis were performed, along with data visualizations developed to provide insight into the effects of social media on mental health.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation Analysis

**Technology:** R, ggplot2

**Results:** This analysis found a statistically significant correlation between the time spent on social media, and the negative effects on mental health in teens.

### The Gateway Effect of Smokeless Tobacco on High School Adolescents
**Code:** [`The Gateway Effect of Smokeless Tobacco on High School Adolescents`](https://github.com/NickWiggz/Projects/blob/main/Smokeless%20Tobacco%20and%20High%20School%20Adolescents.Rmd)

**Document:** [`The Gateway Effect of Smokeless Tobacco on High School Adolescents`](https://github.com/NickWiggz/Projects/blob/main/Smokeless%20Tobacco%20and%20High%20School%20Adolescents.pdf)

**Goal:** To examine whether the use of smokeless tobacco products serves as a predictor for future cigarette smoking among high school students.

**Description:** This project involved analyzing data collected from various high schools, focusing on students' tobacco use habits. The study employed statistical methods to determine if an initial use of smokeless tobacco increased the likelihood of transitioning to cigarette smoking.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Statistical Modeling, Logistic Regression, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization

**Technology:** R

**Results:** The analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship, suggesting that adolescents who use smokeless tobacco are more likely to smoke cigarettes in the future compared to their peers who do not use smokeless tobacco.
